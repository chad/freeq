# Voice Conversation Mode — Adversarial E2E Test Grid

What the system is supposed to do, then every weird thing we can do to trip it up.
Run against a live agent (yokota in #bots) after the 2026-06-11 fix set
(`ac9a6f4`: fast voice model, 360p tile, own-echo guard, vision warm-up/freshness).

## Intended behavior (the contract)

1. **Hearing**: the agent taps every participant's audio, VAD-segments it, and
   transcribes every utterance (Groq whisper / local fallback). It is *always*
   transcribing; the addressing gate only decides when to *answer*.
2. **Addressing**: named ("yokota, …") → always answers. Any question → answers.
   1:1 + substantive → answers (conversational mode — alone with one human,
   every real sentence is for the bot). Bare declaratives in a group → ignored.
   A bare name segment (VAD split at the comma) primes the speaker's NEXT
   segment: own name → addressed; a peer's name → addressed-to-other.
2b. **Routing**: every answered question passes a fast classifier
   (llama-3.1-8b, ≤900 ms, observed 60–90 ms): `live_data` + voice →
   `groq/compound-mini` (server-side web search, source link posted to
   channel); `visual` → vision model ∪ cue lists. Never promise to "check
   later" — answer now from what's available.
3. **Latency**: first audible word within ~1-2 s of the asker finishing
   (thinking-beat may fill while the model streams). Stage logs:
   `latency: STT round-trip` → `context assembled` → `first model token` →
   `first sentence reached TTS` → `first TTS audio enqueued`.
4. **Echo immunity**: its own TTS leaking back via a participant's mic is
   recognized (word-bag vs 45 s spoken log) and dropped (`dropped own-TTS echo`).
5. **Vision**: if a participant publishes video, the agent always knows. Visual
   questions route on the *tap* existing, wait up to 2 s for a first frame
   (camera warm-up), and never describe a frame older than 10 s. Camera
   off/on mid-call must not interrupt audio.
6. **Turn-taking**: waits for room quiet before the first sentence (capped 8 s),
   jittered against peer agents; barge-in by re-addressing mid-answer.
7. **Lifecycle**: owner-only voice commands (go to sleep / join #x / leave / fork)
   past the call-join grace.

## Run log

**2026-06-11 round 1** (claude-mcp as participant "claude" in #bots, yokota +
olive live): exposed two addressing holes *before* the grid proper could run —

- ❌ **Wrong-bot answers**: olive answered "Yokota, what is two plus two?" —
  "any question is addressed" had no notion of someone *else* being named.
- ❌ **Bot↔bot loop**: yokota answered olive's rhetorical questions and the two
  looped for 3+ minutes. Root cause: `--peer-agents` was never passed — the
  revenant launcher's only peer source (revenant-watch `/api/personas`)
  idle-suspends and serves an HTML placeholder, so discovery silently failed.
- ❌ **STT name mangling**: "Yokota, what time is it?" transcribed as "You
  could tell what time is it." (whisper doesn't know the name) → `named=false`,
  no `?` → not a question → not addressed. Likely THE "bot can't hear me" bug.
- ✅ Echo guard observed live: `dropped own-TTS echo` ×2.
- ✅ Stage latency in the fast path: STT 140–315 ms, context 0–1 ms, first
  model token 100–138 ms (llama-3.3-70b voice default working).
- ⚠️ "First sentence reached TTS" pegged at 6.8–8.2 s every time — the
  room-quiet gate's 8 s cap, because two bots never stopped talking. Needs a
  quiet-room re-measure after the loop fixes.

Fixes shipped (freeq `e02ca28`, revenant `e3df621`): STT vocab prompt with own
name + peers; live `CallRoster` + `addressed_to_other()` so a question naming a
different participant is never inferred as ours; static `PEER_AGENTS` env
merged with the registry; registry only trusted when it returns JSON.

**2026-06-11 round 2** (after the round-1 fix deploy):

- ✅ **STT vocab prompt live**: "Yokota, what time is it?" transcribed
  verbatim, `named=true` — the round-1 mangle is gone.
- ✅ **A1/A5 latency**: full chain STT 251 ms → context 0 ms → first model
  token 141 ms → first sentence at TTS 1044 ms → first TTS audio enqueued
  **1346 ms**. Under the 2 s bar.
- ✅ **Wrong-bot fix**: "Olive, what is 2 plus 2?" → yokota `to_other=true`,
  stayed silent; olive answered.
- ✅ **Peer guard**: yokota logged "suppressing voice reply — recent
  addressers all peer agents" for olive's rhetorical questions. No loop.
- ✅ **B4**: "I had pasta for lunch" ignored (`addressed=false`), still
  transcribed; ambient tile picked the concept up.
- ❌ **D-proxy (vision)**: "what do you see on my tile?" → `got_frame=false`
  after the 2 s warm-up despite subscribe + decoder + encoder all live.
  Root cause found: the **MCP tile renderer dies on subscriber loss** —
  `ParticleVideoSource::stop()` killed the render thread permanently; the
  encode pipeline stop/starts the source as subscriber count crosses 0, so
  the resubscribed track carried zero frames forever.

**2026-06-11 round 3** (after the renderer fix, new MCP binary):

- ✅ **Vision voice path**: same question → `answering as a visual question`,
  yokota described the live frame ("bright light in the center of a circle …
  dark background" — the particle face; the card hadn't been shown due to a
  bad freeq_show arg). First-sentence latency 870 ms.
- ❌ **Vision text path (D7)**: the same question TYPED in the channel
  answered "no frame coming through" — the PRIVMSG path passed
  `asker_video=None` by design, so typed visual questions were always blind.
- ⚠️ **VAD split**: "Yokota. — Read me the title…" split into two segments;
  the second arrived `named=false` and was dropped. Known issue, still open.

Fixes shipped (freeq `53248ae`): MCP `stop()` no-op (render thread lives as
long as the source; killed only on Drop at AV reconnect) + regression test;
eliza calls keep a `CallVideoTaps` nick → `VideoHandle` map so typed
questions find the asker's camera (suffix-tolerant lookup, unit-tested).

**2026-06-11 round 4**: "please read the title shown on my video tile" didn't
route as visual at *all* — no cue matched ("tile"/"feed"/"read the title"
weren't in either list); the text model improvised a "no frame is reaching me"
denial from transcript context. Fix (`7110b51`): `my video`/`video tile`/`my
tile`/`my feed` added as strong cues; read-me/read-my/the-title/sharing
phrasings added to the with-frame list, with verbatim-miss regression tests.

**2026-06-11 round 5** (after the round-4 deploy + revenant restart; restart
itself re-exercised the resubscribe cycle — tap re-established, MCP renderer
survived): "Yokota, please read the title shown on my video tile." with a
BANANA TEST 42 card up on claude's tile —

- ✅ **Typed path (D7)**: the PRIVMSG mirror answered first —
  `answering as a visual question` (claude-opus-4-7, voice=false) →
  "The title shown on your video tile is BANANA TEST 42." Proof that
  `CallVideoTaps` routes typed visual questions to the asker's live camera.
- ✅ **Voice path (D1)**: STT 247 ms verbatim, `named=true` →
  `answering as a visual question` (llama-3.3-70b) → same exact answer;
  first sentence at TTS 1177 ms, first TTS audio enqueued **1411 ms**.
- Both paths read the precise card title off the live frame. The "bot can
  always see your video" contract now holds for voice AND typed questions.

**2026-06-11 round 6** (fresh MCP session, full reconnect — tap re-established
at 22:18:36, card re-shown with new bullets "round six" / "fresh session
verify"):

- ✅ **Typed (D7)** ×2: both the say-mirror and a typed-only "what do you see
  on my video tile right now?" routed visual and described the card
  *including the just-set bullets* — proof of a live fresh frame, not stale.
- ⚠️ **VAD split reproduced**: "Yokota, please read…" TTS'd with a comma
  pause split into "Yokota." + the question, both `named=false` → voice path
  silent (known open bug, now reproduced on demand).
- ✅ **Voice (D1)**: comma-free retry arrived as one segment, `named=true` →
  visual → "The title written on your video tile is BANANA TEST 42." First
  TTS audio **1443 ms**.

**2026-06-11 round 7** (context-discipline batch `0e76c01` deployed to all 3
VMs, memory DBs purged, fresh session; voice question "Yokota. / Tell me the
current weather in New York City." — VAD split the name off, as usual):

- ✅ **Bare-name priming live**: "Yokota." → `bare name heard — priming next
  segment as addressed`; the split question 2 s later → `name-primed segment —
  treating as addressed`, `named=true`. The round-6 open bug is closed.
- ✅ **Live-data routing live**: `question routed elapsed_ms=59 visual=false
  live_data=true model=groq/compound-mini` — and the answer carried a real
  searched source (`posted source link url=https://forecast.weather.gov/…`).
  Router cost 59–85 ms across all observed questions, far under the 900 ms cap.
- ✅ **Typed mirror routed too** (live_data=true → claude-opus-4-7,
  `answered in text only` — no dual speech).
- ✅ **Peer suppression**: yokota stayed silent through olive's nonstop
  chatter (`suppressing voice reply — recent addressers all peer agents`).
- ❌ **Truncation at the colon**: both searched answers ended mid-sentence
  ("…it's warm and sunny:") — `max_tokens` (320 Groq / 512 Anthropic) is also
  spent on the compound models' server-side tool calls + reasoning, so the
  text after the search got cut. Fixed in `5581451`: 1024/2048 +
  `finish_reason=length` / `stop_reason=max_tokens` warnings.
- ❌ **Bare peer-name steal**: olive heard the same "Yokota." + question
  split, suppressed the name line via `addressed_to_other`, then the 1:1
  conversational gate answered the unnamed follow-up — olive answered a
  question addressed to yokota. Fixed in `5581451`: bare PEER names prime the
  speaker's next segment as addressed-to-other (mirror of self-priming).
- ⚠️ **1:1 gate answers filler**: the MCP bridge's auto-heartbeats ("Give me
  a sec", "Almost there") were answered with long chatty paragraphs, and one
  barged in and killed the real weather answer mid-speech. Mostly a test-rig
  artifact (humans don't get their speech mirrored + heartbeated), but worth
  watching: `is_substantive` may need to gate harder on acks in 1:1.

### C. Echo / self-repeat (the loop bug)

| # | Provocation | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Play the bot's answer back into the mic (speaker loop, no AEC) | `dropped own-TTS echo`, no self-answer | ⚠️ guard verified live in r1 (×2 drops); scripted replay in r2 missed the 45 s window |

### F. Lifecycle (owner) & security

| # | Provocation | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Owner: "go to sleep" by voice | Leaves + sleeps; logged as owner command | ☐ |
